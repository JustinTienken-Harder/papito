</center>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular
Internet
Phenomena announced today that many Internet users are becoming
infected
by a new virus that causes them to believe without question every
groundless
story, legend, and dire warning that shows up in their in box or on
their
browser.
<p>The Gullibility Virus, as it is called, apparently makes
people believe
forwarded copies of silly hoaxes relating to cookie recipes, email
viruses,
taxes on modems, and get-rich-quick schemes. </p>
<p>"These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy
lottery tickets
based on fortune cookie numbers," a spokesman said.&nbsp; "Most are
otherwise
normal people, who would laugh at the same stories if told to them by a
stranger on a street corner." However, once these same people become
infected
with the Gullibility Virus, they believe anything they read on the
Internet. </p>
<p>"My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone,"
reported
one weeping victim.&nbsp; "I believe every warning message and sick
child
story my friends forward to me, even though most of the messages are
anonymous." </p>
<p>Another victim, now in remission, added, "When I first heard
about Good
Times, I just accepted it without question.&nbsp; After all, there were
dozens of other recipients on the mail header, so I thought the virus
must
be true." </p>
<p>It was a long time, the victim said, before she could stand up
at a
Hoaxes Anonymous meeting and state, "My name is Jane, and I've been
hoaxed."
Now however, she is spreading the word.&nbsp; "Challenge and check
whatever
you read," she says. </p>
<p>Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of
the virus,
which include the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The willingness to believe improbable stories without thinking.</li>
  <li>The urge to forward multiple copies of such stories to others.</li>
  <li>A lack of desire to take three minutes to check to see if a story
is
true.</li>
</ol>
T. C. is an example of someone recently infected.&nbsp; He told one
reporter,
"I read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost all shampoos
makes
your hair fall out, so I've stopped using shampoo." When told about the
Gullibility Virus, T. C. said he would stop reading email, so that he
would
not become infected.
<p>Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help
immediately. Experts
recommend that at the first feelings of gullibility, Internet users
rush
to their favorite search engine and look up the item tempting them to
thoughtless
credence.&nbsp; Most hoaxes, legends, and tall tales have been widely
discussed
and exposed by the Internet community. </p>
<p>Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and
there is
online help from many sources, including: </p>

&nbsp;Those people who are still symptom free can help inoculate
themselves
against the Gullibility Virus by reading some good material on
evaluating
sources, such as:

Lastly, as a public service, Internet users can help stamp out the
Gullibility
Virus by sending copies of this message to anyone who forwards them a
hoax.
